====== TEST 1=====
----------when do reject the null hypothesis------
Reject the null hypothesis when the p-value is less than or equal to your significance level. p <= 0.05

Your sample data favor the alternative hypothesis, which suggests that the effect exists in the population.

----------when do we accept the null hypothesis-------
If there is greater than a 5% chance of a result as extreme as the sample result when the null hypothesis is true, then the null hypothesis is retained.
This does not necessarily mean that the researcher accepts the null hypothesis as trueâ€”only that there is not currently enough evidence to conclude that it is true.



====== TEST 2 ======
If the P-value is less, reject the null hypothesis. 
If the P-value is more, keep the null hypothesis. 

---FOR EXAMPLE
0.003 < 0.05, so we have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis and accept the claim.


====== TEST 3=======
When you can reject the null hypothesis, your results are statistically significant.

Accepting the null hypothesis would indicate that you've proven an effect doesn't exist.
Failing to reject the null hypothesis is an odd way to state that the results of your hypothesis test are not statistically significant.
